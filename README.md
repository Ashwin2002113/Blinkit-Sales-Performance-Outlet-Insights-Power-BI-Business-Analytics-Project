* **Project Overview**

This project focuses on analyzing Blinkit grocery sales data to uncover actionable business insights related to product performance, outlet distribution, and sales trends. The solution transforms raw transactional data into an interactive Power BI dashboard that supports data-driven decision-making.

***Business Objective**

- The primary objective of this project is to help stakeholders:

- Understand sales contribution by product category

- Analyze outlet performance across location tiers and sizes

- Identify high-performing and low-performing product segments

- Which products drive the most revenue

- How outlet location and size affect performance

- Item visibility impact on sales

- This project addresses these challenges by converting raw data into meaningful KPIs and visual insights.

* **Tools & Technologies Used**

- Power BI – Interactive dashboards and data modeling

- Power Query – Data cleaning and transformation

- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Business KPIs and calculations

- Excel / CSV – Source dataset

* **Data Cleaning & Preparation**

- Removed missing and inconsistent values

- Standardized item categories and outlet attributes

- Converted data types for accurate aggregation

- Optimized dataset for analytical modeling

 * Data Model

- Designed a structured analytical model using a fact table
